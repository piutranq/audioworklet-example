# audioworklet-example

The simple audio worklet example.

The example just play the white noise, generated by the same way
(using 15-bit LFSR) of Nintendo GameBoy.


## play the demo

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run serve
```

and browse `http://localhost:8080`

â€» The repo is using `webpack` to build the sources,
but not using `webpack-dev-server` for test/demo.

so every changes are not applied instantly
but need manually rebuild and refresh.
